You can't edit a registration!<br>
Do or do not, there is no edit.<br>
Seriously, though, think about it.  What would you want to edit with a registration?  The student or section? Just go make a new one for that.

I don't think you'd want to change the date, since the system takes care of it when all the registrations are recorded.
